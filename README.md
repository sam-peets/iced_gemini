# Iced Gemini

This is a graphical client for the [Gemini Protocol](https://geminiprotocol.net/) with [Iced](http://iced.rs).

This is primarily a learning exercise. While functional, this client is NOT feature-complete and isn't a great choice for regular browsing.

## Features

- Gemtext rendering
- Image display
- History (to an extent)
- Async networking
- A few other things

## To Do

- [x] Async page loading
- [ ] TOFU cert verification
- [ ] Client certificate handling
- [ ] Support other status codes (input, etc.)
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Progress/status reporting (loading pages is blind right now)
- [ ] File downloading (for unsupported mime-types, offer to save the file)
- [ ] Improved Appearance/Customisation
