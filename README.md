# Iced Gemini

This is a learning exercise for [Iced](http://iced.rs) and the [Gemini Protocol](https://geminiprotocol.net/).

While functional, this client is NOT feature-complete and isn't a great choice for regular browsing.

## Features

- Gemtext Rendering
- Image Support
- History
- A few other things
- Async networking

## To Do

- [ ] TOFU cert verification
- [x] Async page loading
- [ ] Make it look better
- [ ] Client certificate handling
- [ ] Support other status codes (input, etc.)
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Progress/status reporting (loading pages is blind right now)
- [ ] File downloading (for unsupproted mime-types, offer to save the file)
